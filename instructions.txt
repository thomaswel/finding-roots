Write code to find the roots of arbitrary polynomials.  The coefficients
of the polynomial should be stored in an List (Java or Python), or an Integer
array (C).  The coefficients should be user supplied and program validated.
An interval [a,b] should also be user defined and validated.

Given the coefficients for the polynomial p(x):

Calculate the the root of p(x) within [a,b] using the bisection method
Calculate the root of p(x) using Newton's method with x0=(a+b)/2
Use Horner's method to calculate p(x) and p'(x) efficiently
Handle all errors:

What will you do if the root doesn't exist?  How will you test for that?
Don't get caught in infinite loops
How will you terminate the algorithm?
How can you achieve the highest possible precision?
Bonus Points:  Implement in all three languages.
